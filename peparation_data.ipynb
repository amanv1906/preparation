              "246                         Kabali  ...  Let's be honest here, if this movie didn't have Rajinikanth, nobody would've given two f*cks about it because it's that awful and cringeworthy. It has to be one of the most lacklustre movies I've ever watched and comes as a huge disappointment after all the hype and media coverage it got. It's got an extremely banal plot of a Malaysian Tamil gangster Kabali, portrayed by Rajini, involved in a gang war with a local don. There's another storyline that runs parallel, that of his personal life w...\n",

As much as Chulbul Pandey tries to hide his tears behind his sunglasses, the film tries to camouflage its conventional storytelling behind Salman's style.Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) is a totally fearless but corrupt police officer with unorthodox working methods.

A solid story line about friendship and trust and how people see or hear what they want and make assumptions. My daughter (10) and son (8) loved it and they don't understand Hindi - we read the subtitles and had a great time.The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is superb.

The music hands down was great as well, check out the tracks Khuda Jaane, Aahista, and Jogi Mahi for sure! Great writing, scripting, and definitely acting. As newcomers Ranbir and Deepika are contagious, their on screen chemistry (of course) was hot!
